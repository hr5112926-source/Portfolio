    <p>My academic and personal projects have allowed me to apply my foundational coding skills to practical solutions. I have developed simple, functional websites by effectively structuring content with HTML. Furthermore, I have created basic automation scripts and data analysis tools using Python to streamline repetitive tasks. Each project has been a valuable exercise in problem-solving, logical planning, and translating concepts into working code.</p>
